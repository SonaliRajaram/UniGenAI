## Core Features

### 1. **Multi-Agent System**

Your queries are intelligently routed to specialized agents:

| Agent | Capabilities | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Academic**  | Explains concepts, generates study plans, conducts mock interviews | "What is DSA?", "Start mock interview in DSA", "Create study plan for exam" |
| **Code**  | Programming assistance, debugging, error resolution, code explanations | "Write Python function for...", "Debug this error", "Fix Java bug" |
| **Content**  | Content creation, scriptwriting, essays, blogs, creative writing | "Write YouTube script", "Create blog post", "Draft email" |
| **General**  | Casual conversations, general knowledge, random queries | "Hello!", "How are you?", "Tell me a joke" |

**Auto-Agent Switching**: The system detects query type and automatically switches agents while you chat. You can also force a specific agent.

### 2. **Interview Preparation System**

Comprehensive mock interview functionality with real AI evaluation:

- **6 Domains**: DSA, Operating Systems, DBMS, Machine Learning, HR, General
- **Adaptive Questions**: Questions selected from curated question bank
- **AI Evaluation**: Each answer evaluated with scoring and feedback
- **Performance Metrics**: 
  - Individual scores per interview
  - Average score across interviews
  - Improvement tracking
  - Domain-wise performance breakdown
  - First vs. last score comparison

**How it works**:
```
User: "start mock interview"
→ System: "Choose domain: DSA / OS / DBMS / ML / HR / General"
→ User: "DSA"
→ System: Presents Question 1
→ User: Answers question
→ System: Evaluates answer (AI-powered), scores, moves to next
→ After all questions: Calculates metrics and saves results
```

### 3. **Study Planning**

Generate intelligent study schedules:

- **Exam-Date Based**: Input exam date and get day-wise breakdown
- **Topic-Aware**: Organize topics by difficulty and prerequisites
- **Time Allocation**: Balanced daily schedule with review sessions
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion percentage for each plan
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust based on your progress

**Features**:
- Weight-based topic prioritization
- Daily time split across topics
- Built-in review schedules
- Flexible duration handling

### 4. **Document-Based Learning (RAG)**

Learn from your own knowledge sources:

- **Upload Documents**: PDF and TXT file support
- **Semantic Search**: FAISS-powered vector similarity search
- **Context Integration**: Answers augmented with your documents
- **Automatic Chunking**: Smart document segmentation
- **Embeddings**: Using Sentence Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

**How it works**:
```
1. Upload your study notes (PDF/TXT)
2. System processes and creates embeddings
3. When you ask questions, relevant sections are retrieved
4. AI generates answers using both training + your documents
```

### 5. **Real-Time Streaming**

Get instant response feedback:

- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Token-by-token streaming
- **Live UI Updates**: See AI response appear as it's generated
- **No Waiting**: Immediate feedback while AI is thinking
- **Async Architecture**: Non-blocking concurrent request handling
- **Efficient Client Handling**: Smart buffer management for chunks

### 6. **Complete User Management**

Automatic, persistent user sessions:

- **Auto-Creation**: User automatically created on first visit
- **localStorage Persistence**: User ID survives page reloads
- **Multi-User Support**: Each browser/device = separate user
- **Complete Isolation**: Users see only their data
- **No Authentication Required**: Anonymous but tracked

**How it works**:
```
First Visit:
→ System checks localStorage
→ User not found → Create new user
→ Save user ID in localStorage
→ All subsequent requests include user ID

Subsequent Visits:
→ Load user ID from localStorage
→ Continue as same user
→ All chat history and metrics available
```

### 7. **Chat History & Persistence**

Every conversation is saved and accessible:

- **Per-User History**: Each user's chats isolated
- **Searchable**: Retrieve specific conversations
- **Permanent Storage**: Data survives refreshes
- **Role Tagged**: Know which agent responded
- **Timestamped**: When conversations occurred

### 8. **Performance Analytics**

Comprehensive metrics and tracking:

- **Interview Statistics**: Average score, improvement, by-domain breakdown
- **Interview History**: Complete record of all interviews
- **Progress Dashboard**: Track learning over time
- **Comparative Analysis**: First vs. latest performance
- **Domain Breakdown**: Performance in each interview domain

- **localStorage-based**: User ID stored in browser (not transmitted unsecured)
- **Local LLM**: Ollama runs locally (data stays on your machine)
- **SQLite Database**: All data stored locally

### Multi-User Data Isolation
```
Browser 1 (Regular Window)  →  user_id=1  →  Database queries: user_id=1
Browser 2 (Private Window)  →  user_id=2  →  Database queries: user_id=2

Result: Complete isolation, different users see different data
```
