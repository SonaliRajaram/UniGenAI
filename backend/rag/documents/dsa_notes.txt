DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS NOTES

Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently.

Types of Data Structures:
1. Linear Data Structures:
   - Arrays
   - Linked Lists
   - Stacks
   - Queues

2. Non-Linear Data Structures:
   - Trees
   - Graphs
   - Heaps

Arrays:
- Collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
- Advantages: Fast access
- Disadvantages: Fixed size

Linked List:
- Collection of nodes where each node points to the next.
- Types:
  - Singly linked list
  - Doubly linked list
  - Circular linked list

Stack:
- Follows LIFO (Last In First Out).
- Operations: push, pop, peek
- Applications: Expression evaluation, recursion.

Queue:
- Follows FIFO (First In First Out).
- Types: Simple queue, circular queue, priority queue.

Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

Searching Algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search

Time and Space Complexity:
- Big O notation
- Measures algorithm efficiency.
