DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM NOTES

A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently.

Advantages of DBMS:
- Data consistency
- Reduced redundancy
- Data security
- Backup and recovery

Database Models:
- Hierarchical
- Network
- Relational
- Object-oriented

Relational Model:
- Data is stored in tables (relations).
- Each table has rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).
- Primary key uniquely identifies records.

Normalization:
- Process of organizing data to minimize redundancy.
- Normal forms:
  1. First Normal Form (1NF)
  2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
  3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Higher normal forms reduce anomalies.

SQL:
- Structured Query Language used to interact with databases.
- Types:
  - DDL: CREATE, DROP, ALTER
  - DML: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  - DQL: SELECT
  - DCL: GRANT, REVOKE

Transactions:
- A transaction is a unit of work.
- ACID properties:
  - Atomicity
  - Consistency
  - Isolation
  - Durability

Indexing:
- Improves query performance.
- Types:
  - Primary index
  - Secondary index
  - B-tree index
