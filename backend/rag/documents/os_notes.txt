OPERATING SYSTEM NOTES

An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between computer hardware and the user.

Functions of Operating System:
- Process management
- Memory management
- File system management
- Device management
- Security and protection

Process:
- A process is a program in execution.
- Process states: New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated.
- Process Control Block (PCB) stores process information.

CPU Scheduling:
- Determines which process gets CPU time.
- Scheduling algorithms:
  1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  2. Shortest Job First (SJF)
  3. Priority Scheduling
  4. Round Robin

Deadlock:
- A situation where processes wait indefinitely for resources.
- Necessary conditions:
  1. Mutual Exclusion
  2. Hold and Wait
  3. No Preemption
  4. Circular Wait
- Deadlock prevention and avoidance techniques exist.

Memory Management:
- Main memory is limited and must be efficiently allocated.
- Paging:
  - Memory divided into fixed-size pages.
- Segmentation:
  - Memory divided based on logical segments.
- Virtual Memory:
  - Uses disk to extend main memory.
  - Page replacement algorithms: FIFO, LRU, Optimal.

File System:
- Organizes and stores data on storage devices.
- File allocation methods:
  - Contiguous
  - Linked
  - Indexed
