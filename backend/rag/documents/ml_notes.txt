MACHINE LEARNING NOTES

Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning:
   - Training data contains input-output pairs.
   - Examples: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines.
   - Applications: Spam detection, house price prediction, medical diagnosis.

2. Unsupervised Learning:
   - No labeled output.
   - Finds hidden patterns or structure in data.
   - Examples: K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
   - Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.

3. Semi-Supervised Learning:
   - Combination of labeled and unlabeled data.
   - Used when labeled data is scarce.

4. Reinforcement Learning:
   - Agent learns by interacting with an environment.
   - Uses rewards and penalties.
   - Applications: Game playing, robotics, recommendation systems.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
- PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique.
- It transforms high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving maximum variance.
- Steps:
  1. Standardize the data
  2. Compute covariance matrix
  3. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
  4. Select principal components
- Benefits:
  - Reduces computation
  - Removes redundancy
  - Improves visualization

Overfitting and Underfitting:
- Overfitting: Model learns noise and performs poorly on unseen data.
- Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture data patterns.
- Solutions:
  - Regularization
  - Cross-validation
  - More data
  - Feature selection

Model Evaluation Metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

Bias-Variance Tradeoff:
- Bias: Error due to oversimplified assumptions.
- Variance: Error due to sensitivity to data.
- Goal is to balance both.
